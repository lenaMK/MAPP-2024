We discussed the projection/programming aspect of things with @maxime7697 and here is what we were thinking: 
LOUNGE AREA:
- one big TD control patch (on @maxime7697 's computer probably, unless Moment Factory has a better one)
- table interaction in TD, made by @aaa13x and @maxime7697 
- projection on the cloth screens: visuals in TD by @anamika8463 and laser by Boris
- lighting: some lights in the area will be connected to the system to adjust colors based on the table interaction @maxime7697 will see to connect that with the control patch 

BLACK BOX
There are 3 DJ shifts 
- 10PM to 11:30PM: Esther Côté (DJ) and I would be creating visuals with my personnal computer (two things to check: lag if using OBS to transmit the live image; ability to get a mic input for connecting the visuals to the sound )
- 11:30PM to 1AM: Frankie Teardrop (VJ)
